Whale is a dynamic library designed to be used as a multipurpose linear algebra
backend for FEniCS/DOLFIN. This is a prototype implementation that shows the
structure of such a design.

This package includes a patch for FEniCS/DOLFIN 1.6.0 that enables the use of
the library from the mail FEniCS api.

Prerequisites:
        All FEniCS dependencies must be installed on the system, as well as all
        the other core packages FEniCS provides, except for DOLFIN which we are
        going to install. If DOLFIN is previously installed in the installation
        directory, it will be overwritten.

Installation:
        The default installation directory is /opt/FEniCS.This can be changed
        in the install.sh and Makefile files by changing the INSTALL_DIR in both
        of them to point to the desired location.

        To build just the library for independent use,
        run: make

        To build, install and integrate the library into the FEniCS/DOLFIN api,
        run: ./install.sh

Test:
        Run: python demo/demo_whale.py
