Whale is a dynamic library designed to be used as a multipurpose linear algebra
backend for FEniCS/DOLFIN. This is a prototype implementation that shows the
structure of such a design.

This package includes a patch for FEniCS/DOLFIN 1.6.0 that enables the use of
the library from the mail FEniCS api.

Prerequisites:
        All FEniCS dependencies must be installed on the system, as well as all
        the other core packages FEniCS provides, except for DOLFIN which we are
        going to install.

Installation:
        To build just the library for independent use run: make

        To build, install and integrate the library into the FEniCS/DOLFIN api,
        run: ./install.sh

        The default installation directory is /opt/FEniCS.This can be changed
        in the install.sh and Makefile files by changing the INSTALL_DIR in both
        of them to point to the desired location.

Test:
        Run: python demo/demo_whale.py
